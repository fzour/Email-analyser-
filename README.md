  In August 2023, I took on a project to enhance the efficiency of Orange's technical support email system for handling B2B claims. The aim was to streamline the complex task of managing complaints and resolution requests between businesses. This involved using advanced technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). The result was a valuable solution that automatically sorts and prioritizes complaint messages, helping teams respond swiftly to critical issues and allocate resources more wisely in the B2B domain.
